## Data sources
We have the following dynamic data sources:
* [Open-meteo](https://open-meteo.com)
* [Abandoned ski towns](https://abandonedskitowns.com/)
* [Open street map](https://www.openstreetmap.org)

### Assumptions taken regarding the data

#### Abandoned ski towns

* We assume that every ski resort closure registered occured due to climate change i.e lack of snow
* We take no regard to what year ski resorts open, we only utilize the year which they close.
* We take resorts from north America also. This was due to there not being enough qualified closed ski resort samples in Europe to create a large enough training dataset.
